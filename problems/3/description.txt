Round Three

Hi, gentleman. Congratulations with the last round. Solve this! You are taking another step forward to rescue the princess.
The task for this round is that you are given a bunch of numbers, every number appears twice except for one. The key is the special number that appears only once. So please write a program to get the key. Good luck!
